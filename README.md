# GraphQL Codegen Mocks

## A Graphql Codegen plugin for mocking operation results

This plugin generates mock results for operations based on all of your GraphQL documents.

_Note_: This plugin can be used for both JavaScript file outputs as well as TypeScript file outputs, although if you use a TypeScript file as your file output you will also have to ensure that the plugins `@graphql-codegen/typescript` and `@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations` are installed and configured as well.

### Installation

#### npm:

```shell
npm install -D graphql-codegen-mock-results
```

#### Yarn:

```shell
yarn add -D graphql-codegen-mock-results
```
